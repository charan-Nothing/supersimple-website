    <h1>1. The Story of a Rabbit and Tortoise</h1>
    <h3>Once upon a time, in a lush green forest, there lived a rabbit and a tortoise. The rabbit was known for its speed and agility, while the tortoise was known for its slow and steady nature.

        One day, the rabbit boasted about its speed to the tortoise, "I am the fastest animal in the forest, and I can beat you in a race anytime."
        
        The tortoise replied calmly, "It's not just about speed, my friend. It's about determination and perseverance."
        
        The rabbit laughed at the tortoise's words and challenged him to a race. The other animals in the forest gathered to watch the race.
        
        As the race began, the rabbit dashed ahead of the tortoise, leaving him far behind. The rabbit was so confident of his victory that he decided to take a nap midway through the race.
        
        Meanwhile, the tortoise kept moving forward at his slow and steady pace. He did not stop, nor did he get distracted by anything around him. He just kept moving towards the finish line.
        
        When the rabbit woke up from his nap, he realized that he had lost the race. The tortoise had already crossed the finish line, and all the animals in the forest were cheering for him.
        
        The rabbit felt embarrassed and ashamed of his behavior. He went to the tortoise and apologized for his arrogance. The tortoise forgave the rabbit and reminded him that speed was not the only way to win a race.
        
        From that day on, the rabbit learned to respect and appreciate the tortoise's slow and steady nature. The two animals became good friends and would often be seen walking together in the forest. <br></h3>
        
       <h2>The moral</h2> <label> slow and steady wins the race. It is not just about speed, but also about determination, perseverance, and humility.</label>
